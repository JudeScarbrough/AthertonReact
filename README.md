# Atherton Marketing

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Current State

Web application is currently in development.
#### Front End Status ####
UI is fully complete. Logic is 95% complete. Missing integration to the backend server.

#### Back End Status ####
Outline complete. Appointment messaging and group messaging are both 95% complete. Missing request receiving and official server items. Missing final connection to Twilio API.

## Functionality

This web application is for service businesses looking to engage with customers via text messaging. Businesses can set up automated post-appointment texts to customers, prompting them to leave a Google review. Customers can also be sorted into specific groups. Customers within a group can all be sent a text message at once, perhaps a discount code for customers that have only visited once to turn them into repeat customers.

## Pricing

The application will likely launch free for beta testing. Upon feedback and changes, a final version will be launched starting at a price of $50 per month. Price may fluctuate between $15 and $300 per month.

## About

This application was started by and is currently developed by a solo developer.
